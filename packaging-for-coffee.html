        <h1>CONCEPT OF PACKAGING FOR COFFEE</h1>
        <p>Concept of new packaging for coffee. Trying to solve the problem of waste managment.

        <h3>When investigating the properties of coffee, was discovered</h3>
        <p>in the coffee should not get air; coffee produce carbon dioxid; as for all
           bulk products, the shape should be round.</p>
        <p>Packaging was thought out. The material from which the packaging
           made is recycled paper. Inside, food foil. This allows restrict access to
           air but at the same time passes carbon dioxide. Cylindrical packing
           which is handy ergonomically and in everyday life.</p>
        <p>Researches show that for half a year coffee in such packaging has
           not lost its flavor. The layout was made by hand. I can assume that
           with a more professional manufacturing approach coffee can be stored</p>
        <h3>The packaging can be used again.</h3>
        <p>The design of the package contains a hole. From the hole can pour
           out the coffee. After use it can be filled with other products.
           for 3 years. Alternatives in the use of material are also possible.

        <h1>VISUAL PACKAGING DESIGN</h1>
        <p>Created by TM "Putm". Theme is music. The music that transmits
           the mood and emotions. Three directions in music: jazz, classical and
           hrad-rock. A palette of colors is chosen based on musical covers.
           Made illustrations that convey the rhythms of music. The Bliss Pro font
           is used to send information. Created icons and table roasting coffee.</p>
